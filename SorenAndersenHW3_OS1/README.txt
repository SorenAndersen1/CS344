Hello

For this assignment I used compileall to compile, so to compile just run "compileall" and it should be good to use the test script from there.
Again this week I had an issue of redirecting the output of the testing script function to its own file, so if the testing file itself doesnt work with the command
given "./p3gradingscript PORT1 PORT2 > mytestresults 2>&1" I just ran it like "./p3gradingscript PORT1 PORT2".

Other than that I thought this assignment was cool cause it was the first time I had done anything with encryption which was fun to learn. 

The only thing that doesnt work is the plaintext4 since its so long, however, 
if you try it at the command line it should work most of the time (90%) I just didn't have enough time to get it working in the script. 
Not nessecarily saying you shoudld try the command line if it results in a deduction of my grade. Thanks
